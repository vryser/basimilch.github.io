### Cache busting

To try to ensure that our custom assets (mainly [`javascripts/custom.js`] and
[`css/custom.css`]) are reloaded by the clients when we update them, we add a
query param `?bust={{ site.time | date: '%s' }}`, which has a dynamic value
equal to the linux timestamp of the building time, as described [in this article].

[`javascripts/custom.js`]: javascripts/custom.js
[`css/custom.css`]: css/custom.css
